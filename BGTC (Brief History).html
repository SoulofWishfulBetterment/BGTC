                            <h2 class="header-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> (Birth and Death: 10 December 1815 - 27 November 1852)</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>Ada Lovelace is recognised by historians as the first computer programmer. Born in 1815, Ada loved
                            and studied mathematics which in her time was highly unusual for a woman. Her great interest in 
                            mathematics was kick-started after meeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>,
                            the inventor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>. 
                            In September 1843, an article about Mr. Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine would be published. This
                            article had extensive notes added by Mrs. Lovelace when she was commissioned to write an English 
                            translation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Federico_Menabrea">Luigi Menabrea</a>'s 
                            paper which was a French transcribed lecture of Mr. Babbage's Analytical Engine. These notes were
                            the very reason why Mrs. Ava Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer.

                            <h2 class="header-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> (Birth and Death: 23 June 1912 - 7 June 1954)</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>However, Ms. Lovelace's contribution to coding was just the beginning.  In 1923, German military combined 
                            coding and electricity, communicating via secret coded messages on the Enigma machine. Alan Turing 
                            famously cracked the code, reportedly helping end the war two years earlier than predicted. Turing 
                            later took the concept and evolved it, creating a more flexible machine in 1936. Unlike its 
                            predecessors, Turing's computer could complete more than one task, due to its ability to read multiple 
                            instructions in binary code.
                        </p>

                        <p>The drawback to Turing's design was the fact that it read instructions via long tapes of paper, which 
                            proved impractical. In 1948, researchers at Manchester University came up with a solution - the ability 
                            to store memory via electricity. Their computer was programmed via binary code, held 128 bytes of 
                            memory, and was large enough to fill an entire room.

                            <h2>A Boom in Creation of Coding Languages</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>The late 1950s saw the invention of coding languages that are still in use today - specifically, FORTRAN, 
                            LISP and COBOL. Technology swiftly unfolded throughout the 60s, with the notion of computer gaming being 
                            born, the mouse being invented, and ARPANET, the predecessor to the internet, being created. The 1970s 
                            brought further development: the high-level programming language PASCAL was forged; interestingly, it
                            was used by Skype in the past.
